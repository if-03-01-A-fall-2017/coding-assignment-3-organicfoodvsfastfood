      <h2>What is Organic food?</h2>
        <p>Organic means produce and other organic ingredients in retail products are grown without the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, sewage sludge, genetically modified organisms or ionizing radiation. Animals that produce meat, poultry, eggs and dairy products are not given antibiotics or growth hormones.</p>

        <p>An organic production system is managed to respond to site-specific conditions by integrating cultural, biological and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance and conserve biodiversity.</p>

        <p>Companies that handle or process organic food before it reaches grocery store shelves or restaurant kitchens must also be certified. Organic handlers cook, bake, mix, extract, freeze, package, process or otherwise modify raw organic materials. These handlers protect the food from contact with prohibited substances and from commingling with nonorganic products.</p>

        <p>Food products that are certified organic by QAI have been verified to meet strictly defined standards issued by national and international standards issuing bodies, such as the USDA, or other independent agencies.

        <h2>Why is Organic food important?</h2>
        <p>When you support the organic industry, you help the environment by reducing the use of synthetic chemicals. Chemicals used in conventional food production often leach back into the surrounding environment. By using more natural practices, organic production protects wildlife, promotes biodiversity and helps to maintain and improve native ecosystems.</p>

        <p>The organic process is environmentally conscious. It promotes greater soil fertility by rotating crops and using natural materials, such as compost, manure and cover crops. These practices help to control erosion and manage soil nutrients. A healthy soil also has the ability to absorb more carbon from the air.</p>

        <p>In order for animal products to be certified organic, the producing animals must meet a standard of animal welfare that ensures livestock living conditions accommodate the health and natural behavior of the animals. This includes being feed a natural diet with no growth hormones, GMOs or antibiotics. The animals also cannot be cloned.</p>
